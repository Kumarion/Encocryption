# StringEncoder
 
# Encryption
Support for encryption (and later decryption) of data.
Current supported algorithms are:

- SHA2
- SHA-224
- SHA-256
- SHA-384
- SHA-512
- SHA-512/224 (tba)
- SHA-512/256 (tba)

- SHA3
- SHA3-224
- SHA3-256
- SHA3-384
- SHA3-512

- Definitley more to come

# Encoder
Support for encoding (and later decoding) of data.
Current supported algorithms are:
- Base16 (Hexadecimal)
- Base64 
- Base91 (recommended for datastores)
- More?

For the future, there will be options to have results returned as encoded strings...
